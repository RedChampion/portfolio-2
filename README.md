# Portfolio 2

## What is Portfolio 2?
Portfolio 2 is an updated portfolio page that includes past and current projects.

## How does Portfolio 2 work?
Portfolio 2 is simple to navigate.  By using the NavBar at the top the user can switch between the 3 pages (Homepage, Portfolio, and Contact)<br>

On the Portfolio page there are a number of containers that have scroll bars.  Each of these containers had the README.md, HTML, CSS and Javascript code in them.  By scrolling down the user can see all the code used in the project.  Above each box there are two buttons, one will redirect the user to the deployed version of the project and the other will redirect them to the project's Github Repository.
